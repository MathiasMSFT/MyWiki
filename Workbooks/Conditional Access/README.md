# New Conditional Access insights and reporting

In the default workbook, you can not select the type of identity and if you want have some CAP to address guest access, you will see that information are not relevent.
So to address that, I created a new workbook and added a new filter name "Type of user"

Select what type of account you want to see:
- Member
- Guest
- All
