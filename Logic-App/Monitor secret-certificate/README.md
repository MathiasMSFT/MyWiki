# How to monitor secrets & certificates with notifications
[![fr](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-fr-blue.svg)](README-fr.md)

## Prerequisites

### Logic App for notification
This Logic App is designed to call another Logic App, currently without email notification functionality.
To create this Logic App, follow the instructions here üëâ [README file](../Notifications/README.md).

### Custom Security Attributes
Custom Security Attributes (CSA) are not simple attributes. By default, Global Admin members don't have any permissions to manage them. Creating "sets" and "attributes" (CSA) require roles that you have to manage by PIM (Privileged Identity Management):
- Attribute Definition Administrator or Reader
- Attribute Assignment Administrator or Reader

In this case, I have created a set named "OwnerManagement". In this set, I have created an attribute named "AppOwner" which will store all owners of my applications.

</p>

</p>

**Important:** Once created, you cannot delete a CSA, only disable it.

üìç If you would like to use your own Set and Custom Security Attribute, here is what you need to update in the template:

Here are the lines you need to change:
- Line 279: OwnerManagement
- Line 284: AppOwner
- Line 290: AppOwner
- Line 334: OwnerManagement / AppOwner
- Line 371: OwnerManagement / AppOwner
- Line 443: OwnerManagement / AppOwner
- Line 570: OwnerManagement / AppOwner
- Line 576: OwnerManagement / AppOwner
- Line 664: OwnerManagement / AppOwner



## Deployment
Deploy through 2 steps:

1. Deploy the ARM template in your subscription and fill all the fields
- Resource Group
- Region
- Logic App Name
- Logic App Notification
- Frequency / Interval (See the documentation below)
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-native-recurrence?tabs=consumption
- Mail from
- Mail Report
2. Assign permissions


### Deployment template

You can deploy the ARM templates to your Azure Subscription using the link below:

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMathiasMSFT%2FMyWiki%2FLogic%20App%2FMonitor%20secret-certificate%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton"/>
</a>

You should see a failed run and that's normal because your Managed Identity doesn't have any permissions.


## After deployment

### Permissions on Managed Identity
Then, you need to give permissions to your Managed Identity:
- read applications
- read Custom Security Attributes

1. Find objectid of MI
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="70%" src="./images/ManagedIdentity-ObjectID.png">
</p>

2. Use the script below. Replace values by your own
```
$TenantID = "<tenantid>"
$GraphAppId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
$DisplayNameMI = "<name of your Logc App>"
$GraphPermissions = @('CustomSecAttributeAssignment.Read.All','Application.Read.All')

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes Application.Read.All,AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All -TenantId $TenantID

$IdMI = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "DisplayName eq '$DisplayNameMI'"

## Get assigned roles
Get-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $IdMI.Id

ForEach ($GraphPermission in $GraphPermissions) {
    ## Get Graph roles
    $GraphServicePrincipal = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"
    $AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $GraphPermission -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}

    $AppRole

    $params = @{
        principalId = $IdMI.Id
        resourceId = $GraphServicePrincipal.Id
        appRoleId = $AppRole.Id
    }

    ## Add permission to Managed Identity 
    New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $params.principalId -ResourceId $params.resourceId -PrincipalId $params.principalId -AppRoleId $params.appRoleId
}

## Get assigned roles
Get-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $IdMI.Id
```

## Run the logic app

Run your Logic App and validate in "Run History" blade that it works coorectly.

Admins or IGA team will receive one email containing all applications with secret(s) or certificate(s) which are expired (including all details):
- Application Id
- Name of the application
- Key Id (secret id or certificate id)
- How many days since the secret/certificate is expired
- Email of owners


Owners of applications will receive an email for each app containing:
- Name of the application
- In how many days the secret/certificate will expire
- Key Id (secret id or certificate id)
- Expiration time
- Application Id
